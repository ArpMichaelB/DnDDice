# DnDDice
Originally a 30 minute self-challenge project. The original 30 minutes to completion code resides in the master branch.
Designed to be a set of dice which is variable based on user input. As the name of the repo implies, intended to be used for Dungeons and Dragons.
Currently in the process of adding incremental improvements to the application, see branches in feat/ for examples of changes.
Develop gets the features from feat/ branches as they're completed.
